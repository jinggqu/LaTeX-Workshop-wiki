## Helpful tool

The [`check-config.py`](./check-config.py) script can be useful to check

- If some configuration variables have been removed from LaTeX-Workshop but are still referenced in ths wiki.
- If some actual configuration variables are missing from the wiki
- If for every configuration variable the default value reported in the wiki is the same as the one in LaTeX-Workshop.
